# put latest building instructions here
# THIS IS OBSOLETE FOR GMS2. See readme.md in SwigFiles_DM2_64
1. Swig files:
cd C:\Users\matt\Dropbox\personal\dev\Dimpy
cd SWIGFiles
..\swigwin-2.0.4\swig.exe -c++ -python -shadow -builtin DigitalMicrograph.i
# should create DigitalMicrograph_wrap.cxx

2. building python dimpy dll
build DimPy_Console in vs2010 using v90 tools
Keep seeing mt.exe failed with code 31 errors...
	 ** Remove folder from Windows Defender path to prevent this**
Just building after (not rebuilding) seems to fix it

3. build DimpyLoader
use vs2010 with v90 tools.
